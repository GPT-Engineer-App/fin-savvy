Develop a budget planning website/app that enables users to effectively manage their finances. The platform should allow users to input their income, expenses, and savings goals, providing intuitive tools for budget creation and tracking. Key features should include:

User-Friendly Interface: Design a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to input and visualize their financial data.

Budget Creation: Implement a feature for users to set up monthly budgets by categorizing their expenses (e.g., groceries, bills, entertainment) and allocating funds accordingly.

Expense Tracking: Enable users to track their spending in real-time, categorizing transactions and providing visual representations of their financial activity.

Goal Setting: Allow users to set savings goals and track their progress over time, with notifications to help them stay on track.

Customization Options: Provide flexibility for users to customize budget categories, set spending limits, and adjust goals as needed.

Financial Insights: Offer personalized insights and recommendations based on users' financial data to help them make informed decisions and improve their financial health.

Ensure that the website/app prioritizes user privacy and security, adhering to best practices for handling sensitive financial information. Additionally, optimize the platform for mobile devices to accommodate users who prefer to manage their finances on the go.
